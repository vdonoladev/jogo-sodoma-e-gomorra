In this game, you must convince God not to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18: 24-32).
Something quite difficult, but here we go:

At the "Eu:" prompt, type:

-> Senhor, e se houver xyz justos na cidade? (Sir, what if there are righteous xyz in the city?)

(Where 'xyz' corresponds to a number between 0 and 999)

Remember: Type right to end soon!

Good luck!!!
